## â€ŠGeneral

### What is Proof of Stake?

Proof of Stake is a consensus protocol coming to Ethereum in 2020. Currently Ethereum uses the Proof of Work (PoW) protocol, which you may have heard of before, because Bitcoin uses PoW. With a decentralised blockchain, these consensus protocols help keep everyone on the same page, so we all know what transactions have been processed and in what order.

Ethereum will transition to a new Proof of Stake (PoS) chain called the beacon chain, which is faster, more energy efficient and more decentralised than PoW. It's powered by users depositing ETH and providing an Ethereum node online 24/7 to perform the required validation. As a reward for providing the node, the beacon chain gives node operators additional ETH on top of their deposits. It can be viewed similarly to earning interest in a bank account, with the exception these rewards are generated in return for helping secure the network.
