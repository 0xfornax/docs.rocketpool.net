# :chart_with_upwards_trend: [NYI] How to Stake with Rocket Pool

# TODO

This should be a complete guide of how to stake ETH for rETH.
It can be largely derived from the existing Medium guide.


## Unstaking

This should talk about the process if returning rETH for ETH, and describe **the liquidity pool**.
Might also want to suggest other sources of liquidity (e.g. Uniswap) if the deposit pool doesn't have enough liquidity to cover things.
