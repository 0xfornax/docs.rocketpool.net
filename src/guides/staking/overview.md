# :book: Staking Overview

# TODO

This should have an overview of the aspects of staking with Rocket Pool.
A brief recap of what staking is, how it works in Rocket Pool (what is rETH), etc.
It doesn't have to be a complete rundown (that doesn't belong in the guides section), just a recap.


## Tax Implications

It would be a good idea to mention that in some countries, swapping ETH for rETH may be considered a taxable event, so the user will have to assess this accordingly with a tax professional.
Offer some guidance here - where to go to ask questions, who can provide answers, links to any existing documentation.
