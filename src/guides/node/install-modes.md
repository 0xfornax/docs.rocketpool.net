# :cd: Selecting a Rocket Pool Mode

# TODO

Give a brief rundown of the different ways Rocket Pool can be used:
- Default (full nodes via Docker) setup
- Hybrid (Docker with external clients) setup
- Native (no Docker) setup

The guides under this should describe the setup for each of the above in their entirety, rather than forcing the normal setup and re-configuring it afterwards.
