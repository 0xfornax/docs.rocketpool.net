# :cd: Installing the Operating System

[TBD] A quick run-down of Operating Systems, which to pick, and links to installation guides that exist elsewhere (preferably official ones maintained by the distro teams).

This can also be where we describe how to do things like setting up a 2nd hard drive if applicable, running an IOPS test with `fio`, setting up swap space... everything someone might need to do. The `fio` test is important I think, but the other stuff might be skippable.
