## Overview

Rocket Pool is a first of its kind Ethereum 2.0 Staking protocol, designed to be highly decentralised, distributed and trustless.   It  was   first   conceived   in   late  2016  and   has   since   had   several successful public betas over the life span of ETH2 development.

The staking network allows any individual, business, defi dapp, wallet provider, SaaSprovider, exchange — just about any service — the ability to provide their users withthe option to earn staking rewards on their ETH holdings without worrying aboutmaintaining an extensive staking infrastructure, just plug and play.

Staking with the Rocket Pool network is very flexible and unlike any other staking infrastructure for Ethereum 2.0 to date. When depositing ETH into the Rocket Pool smart contracts, you will be instantly issued a token called rETH which represents a tokenised staking deposit in the network. You can hold this for any duration, sell it, trade it or do as you wish and its value will be reflected by the work each individual decentralised node operator gives the Rocket Pool network.
